Do you want to:
- Add Student

## Features
Features of Course Registration Portal are listed as follows:
- Handling multiple connections. i.e., Serving multiple clients simultaneously.
- Socket programming is used to implement client-server model.
- TCP connection for effective and reliable communication.
- Storage/ Database: Unix File System. i.e., data is stored typically in files only.
- Concurrency: File Locking (both mandatory and advisory locking) while operating files for consistency.
Semaphores protection as mutex/ binary locks may be used for Critical Section of the code in future scope.
- Only system calls are used directly, avoiding use of library functions.
